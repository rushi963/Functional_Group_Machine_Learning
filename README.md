## **Priority Based Functional Group Identification of Organic Molecules using Machine Learning -**

Functional groups in organic compounds determine the properties of the compounds/molecules. When multiple functional groups are present, the dominant functional group determines majority of the properties of the compound. Hence priority based identification of functional groups is an important problem in chemistry. Fourier-transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a commonly used spectroscopic method for identifying the presence or absence of functional groups within a compound, and the current approach for this task mainly relies on visual inspection and analysis of the FTIR spectral data. However, such visual identification process by humans is error prone, especially when patterns in the FTIR spectrum overlap, resulting in loss of uniqueness of features which help in identification of different functional groups in the unknown sample. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to develop a machinelearning based classification system which can perform priority based functional group identification of organic molecules.
